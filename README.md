Landing Page Project (HTML, CSS and Flexbox) for TOP

Goals: To create a well-designed landing page using what I've gathered about CSS and Flexbox for positioning. This will be the sum of all I've learned so far about HTML and CSS, and writing both the HTML and Stylesheet from scratch, trying to position everything well for the first time.
